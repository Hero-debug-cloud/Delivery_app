## 3. Implemented Modules

### Module 1: Authentication System ✅ Completed
- **Database Sessions**: Custom `sessions` database table (HttpOnly Lax Session Cookie) for Next.js Admin Panel.
- **OTP Verification**: Redis-backed temporary OTP storage (5-minute TTL) printed to console in development.
- **Dual-Role OTP Auto-Registration**: `POST /auth/otp/verify` accepts an optional `role` field (`"delivery_partner"` | `"customer"`). If the phone number has no existing account, a new one is created for that role. Drivers also get a `delivery_partners` record with `onboardingStatus: pending`; customers get a plain `users` record.
- **Admin Roles**: Supports `super_admin`, `store_manager`, and `dispatcher`.
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `POST /auth/admin/login` (email/phone + password comparison via `Bun.password.verify`)
  - `POST /auth/admin/signup` (creates admin profile and starts session)
  - `POST /auth/otp/request` (initiates 6-digit verification code generation)
  - `POST /auth/otp/verify` (validates OTP, auto-creates account by role if new, returns session + driver profile)
  - `GET /auth/me` (retrieves session + driver profile with presigned document URLs)
  - `PATCH /auth/me` (updates user details/email/phone/password credentials)
  - `POST /auth/logout` (destroys active session)
- **Verification**:
  - Automated bash smoke tests (`./scripts/smoke-test-auth.sh`) run 19 checks and pass 100%.

---

### Module 2: Catalog & Storage Management ✅ Completed
- **Backend-Driven Catalog Operations**:
  - Moved all list search (`ilike`), sorting (`name`, `price`, `createdAt`), and filters (`storeId`, `categoryId`, `inStock`, `isVeg`) to the Hono backend.
  - Implemented server-side metadata pagination (`page`, `limit`, `totalItems`, `totalPages`, `hasNext`, `hasPrevious`).
  - Extended `products` table schema with detailed specs: `images` (jsonb array of strings for multiple image uploads), `brand` (text), `shelf_life` (text), `origin` (text), and `ingredients` (text).
- **Private Object Storage (MinIO / S3)**:
  - Setup `/upload` route with file-size validation (<5MB) and MIME-type restrictions.
  - Dual S3 Client Setup: Configured `s3Client` for internal container-to-container network queries (`minio:9000`) and a dedicated `signingS3Client` for local-host browser resolutions (`localhost:9000`).
  - Added URL parameter cleaner (`extractS3Key` in `s3.ts`) to extract raw keys (e.g. `uploads/uuid.png`) from presigned URLs, avoiding database pollution on edits.
- **Web Frontend Integration**:
  - Deleted all client-side array sorting/filters in `client-admin/src/app/(admin)/products/page.tsx`.
  - Configured infinite-scroll selectors (`InfiniteSelect`) for Category/Store associations.
  - Added standard `PaginationFooter` that binds directly to backend-provided metadata.
  - Added `MultiImageUploadField` drag-and-drop component to `ProductModal` supporting up to 5 images, size/type validations, main image highlight, and real-time upload progress.
- **Verification**:
  - Automated bash smoke tests (`./scripts/smoke-test-products.sh`) run 21 catalog checks and pass 100%.

---

### Module 3: Driver Onboarding & Management ✅ Completed
- **Database Schema**:
  - Extended `delivery_partners` table with onboarding statuses (`pending`, `submitted`, `approved`, `rejected`), rejection reason, license fields (number, expiry, front/back URLs), identity proof fields, and profile picture URL.
  - `vehicleType` and `vehicleNumber` are nullable to allow admin-created registrations without initial vehicle info.
- **Backend API** (`server/src/features/delivery-partners/`):
  - Added `/upload` permissions for `delivery_partner` role to support onboarding document uploads.
  - `PATCH /delivery-partners/me/onboard` — driver submits name, vehicle, license, and document S3 keys; status transitions to `submitted`.
  - `GET /delivery-partners` — admin lists drivers filtered by `onboardingStatus` / search, with full pagination metadata.
  - `POST /delivery-partners/:id/approve` — sets status to `approved`.
  - `POST /delivery-partners/:id/reject` — sets status to `rejected` and stores `rejectionReason`.
  - `POST /delivery-partners` (**manual creation**) — admin creates a driver directly (inserts `users` + `delivery_partners` in a transaction). Driver can then log in via OTP and complete onboarding.
- **Admin Panel UI** (`client-admin/src/features/delivery-partners/`):
  - Driver list organised into tabs: Verification Queue, Active Partners, Rejected, Draft Setup, All Drivers.
  - `DriverVerificationModal` — glassmorphic modal with document previews and approve/reject actions.
  - `CreateDriverModal` — form for manually creating a driver (name, phone, email, store, vehicle type/plate) using Zod + React Hook Form.
- **Flutter Driver App** (`client-app/lib/screens/`):
  - `DriverOnboardingScreen` — multi-step form (profile pic, vehicle, license, ID proof) with `image_picker` file uploads and a rejection banner for re-submissions.
  - `OnboardingReviewScreen` — waiting screen with a refresh-status button.
  - GoRouter redirects by status: `pending`/`rejected` → `/onboarding`, `submitted` → `/onboarding-review`, `approved` → `/dashboard`.
- **Verification**:
  - Automated bash smoke tests (`./scripts/smoke-test-driver-onboarding.sh`) run **26 checks** (full back-and-forth flow + manual creation + OTP login) and pass 100%.

---

### Module 4: Store / Warehouse Management ✅ Completed
- **Database Schema**:
  - `stores` table with fields: `id`, `name`, `address`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `phone`, `openingTime` (defaults to `"10:00"`), `closingTime` (defaults to `"19:00"`), `isActive`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.
- **Backend API** (`server/src/features/stores/`):
  - `GET /stores` — lists stores with server-side search (`ilike` on name/address), `isActive` filter, and metadata pagination. Public access.
  - `POST /stores` — create a new store. Requires `super_admin` role.
  - `GET /stores/:id` — fetch a single store by ID. Public access.
  - `PATCH /stores/:id` — update store details (name, phone, location, status). Requires `super_admin` or `store_manager`.
  - `DELETE /stores/:id` — soft-delete with active order/driver constraint checks. Requires `super_admin`.
  - Zod schema validation (`createStoreSchema`, `updateStoreSchema`) with role-based middleware guards.
- **Admin Panel UI** (`client-admin/src/features/stores/`):
  - Store list table with debounced search, status filter dropdown, toggle active switch, edit and delete actions.
  - `StoreModal.tsx` — full create/edit form with:
    - Store name, phone, and operating timings (openingTime, closingTime time pickers) with validation.
    - Active status toggle.
    - **Leaflet + OpenStreetMap** interactive map coordinate picker (no API key required).
    - Real-time Nominatim geocoding search with autocomplete dropdown.
    - **"Locate Me"** button using browser `navigator.geolocation` → auto-pins current GPS location.
    - Reverse geocoding on every map click / locate action to auto-fill address field.
    - Confirm Location flow locks in `latitude`, `longitude`, and `address` before form submission.
  - TanStack Query hooks for create, update, delete, toggle mutations with automatic cache invalidation.
- **Admin Layout**:
  - Added persistent **global footer** to `client-admin/src/app/(admin)/layout.tsx` with copyright, version badge, Docs/API Health links, and animated system status indicator.
  - Refactored sidebar navigation to support collapsible layouts, floating popover account options, administrative profile settings, and status cycling controls.
- **Verification**:
  - TypeScript compilation (`bun x tsc --noEmit`) passes with 0 errors on both server and client-admin.

---

### Module 5: Flutter Customer App ✅ Completed
- **Role-Based Authentication**:
  - `PhoneInputScreen` — dual-tab UI: **Customer** vs **Delivery Partner** role selector.
  - `OtpVerifyScreen` — receives role via GoRouter `state.extra` (supports both plain `String` phone and `Map<String, dynamic>` with `phone`+`role`); passes it to `POST /auth/otp/verify`.
  - `AuthUser` model extended with optional `email` field.
- **GoRouter Role Guards** (`client-app/lib/main.dart`):
  - `MultiBlocProvider` at app root: `AuthCubit` + `ProductCubit` + `CartCubit`.
  - `authState is! AuthAuthenticated` smart-cast eliminates redundant variable declarations.
  - Customers are redirected to `/home` and blocked from all driver/admin routes.
  - Approved drivers are redirected to `/dashboard` and blocked from all customer routes (`/home`, `/search`, `/products/*`, `/customer-profile`).
- **Customer Screens** (`features/products/presentation/screens/`):
  - `CustomerHomeScreen` — animated category tab bar, product grid, `BottomCartSheet`, search shortcut.
  - `ProductSearchScreen` — debounced live search (300ms) with inline add-to-cart controls.
  - `ProductDetailScreen` — full product info (name, price, discount, unit, veg badge), quantity stepper, add-to-cart CTA.
  - `CustomerProfileScreen` — displays name, phone, email; logout action.
- **Cart** (`features/cart/`):
  - `CartCubit` manages `Map<String, CartItem>` in-memory; exposes `addItem`, `removeItem`, `clearCart`.
  - `CartState` computes `itemCount`, `itemTotal`, `deliveryFee` (free above ₹199), `handlingCharge`, `grandTotal`.
  - `BottomCartSheet` — floating persistent bar; opens order summary modal with bill breakdown.
- **Remaining (future)**:
  - Order placement API + checkout flow.
  - Real-time delivery tracking (OSRM / WebSocket).
  - Push notification integration.

---

### Module 6: Staff & Customer Management ✅ Completed
- **Backend APIs** (`server/src/features/users/`):
  - Added `/users` route containing robust filtering (`type` selector for staff vs customer vs driver, active status filter), search (`ilike` queries on name/email/phone), sorting (`name`, `role`, `createdAt`), and backend-driven pagination.
  - Implemented secure user creation via `POST /users` (hashes passwords for staff with bcrypt) and update operations via `PATCH /users/:id`.
  - Added constraint-guarded soft deletions via `DELETE /users/:id` (blocks deleting user if active orders or delivery partner profiles exist).
- **Admin UI Panels** (`client-admin/src/app/(admin)/`):
  - Created `/users` page for Staff Management displaying active status, joined dates, and formatted administrative role badges (`super_admin`, `store_manager`, `dispatcher`).
  - Created `/customers` page for Customer Management displaying active profiles, contact info, and registration details.
  - Embedded customizable glassmorphic `UserModal` (combining Zod and React Hook Form validation) for profile editing/creation.
  - Added interactive active-status toggling and delete confirmation warning gates.

---

### Module 7: Saved Addresses System ✅ Completed
- **Database Schema**:
  - `customer_addresses` table: Added `recipientName` and `recipientPhone` columns to support custom delivery contacts or gifting orders.
- **Backend APIs** (`server/src/features/customer-addresses/`):
  - `GET /customer-addresses` — fetches list of saved customer addresses, ordered with active default address first.
  - `POST /customer-addresses` — creates a new address record. Automatically promotes the first created address to default, and clears old defaults if `isDefault` is set.
  - `PATCH /customer-addresses/:id` — updates label, address text, coordinates, default status, and recipient info.
  - `DELETE /customer-addresses/:id` — removes address. Automatically promotes the next most recent address to default if the deleted address was default.
- **Flutter Customer Client App** (`client-app/lib/features/addresses/`):
  - Setup modular architecture with `AddressRemoteSource`, `AddressRepository`, and state management managed via `AddressCubit` and `AddressState`.
  - `SavedAddressesScreen` — displays saved addresses with intuitive visual default indicator and swift deletion/navigation links.
  - `AddEditAddressScreen` — beautiful form utilizing location pinning, recipient credentials (name/phone), label selector (Home, Work, Other), and default selection switch.

---

### Module 8: Driver Shift Management & Geofenced Activation ✅ Completed
- **State Sync & Telemetry Backend APIs** (`server/src/features/delivery-partners/` and `server/src/features/telemetry/`):
  - `PATCH /delivery-partners/me/status` — updates active driver duty status (`online` / `offline`) and updates the `storeId` they are currently active at. Cleans up Redis cache and sends WebSocket offline events.
  - Profile sync `/auth/me` resolves store configuration dynamically including details and operating hours.
  - `GET /delivery-partners/me/profile` — retrieves the driver's full profile details (vehicle records, license, active warehouse/store, S3 presigned document URLs).
  - `PATCH /delivery-partners/me/profile` — updates driver name, email, or profile picture URL key.
  - `POST /locations/ping` — REST endpoint to receive coordinates, velocity, and battery levels from active drivers. Updates Redis GEO index, sends real-time coordinates to WebSocket clients tracking that driver, and asynchronously logs coordinate histories to the PostgreSQL `location_pings` table without blocking.
  - `GET /locations/ws` — Bun Hono WebSocket upgrade route supporting subscription payloads (`subscribe`/`unsubscribe`) to selectively stream telemetry.
  - `GET /locations/live` — Fetches current online drivers from Redis GEO index, filters out inactive sessions (>60s since last ping), and supports pagination (`page`, `limit`) and `search` query parameters. Mounts `/locations/online` as a fallback alias.
- **Flutter App Architecture**:
  - `ShiftManager` (`client-app/lib/core/shift_manager.dart`) — singleton state manager notifying subscribers of changes to active driver duty status and coordinates. Houses the **10-second periodic telemetry Timer** that pings `/locations/ping` using real-time `Geolocator` coordinates and real device battery level via the `battery_plus` package.
  - `GoLiveScreen` (`client-app/lib/screens/go_live.dart`) — lists active stores sorted by distance relative to the driver's current coordinates using Haversine calculation. Enforces a 100m geofence limit to transition online. Includes a simulated location toggle for testing near the chosen hub.
  - `DashboardScreen` (`client-app/lib/screens/dashboard.dart`) — bottom tabbed layout containing three navigation targets:
    1. **Dashboard Tab**: Displays shift control card (offline button to start shift or online telemetry banner with dynamic location status) and announcements list.
    2. **Tasks Tab**: Displays assignments list (currently empty placeholder).
    3. **Profile Tab**: Renders driver's personal and vehicle profile details using `ProfileScreen`.
  - `ProfileScreen` (`client-app/lib/screens/profile.dart`) — Renders driver details, verified documents section (tappable cards opening fullscreen image dialog previews), and:
    - **Initials Fallback**: Displays the uppercase first and last letters of the driver's name in the avatar circle if `profilePictureUrl` is empty/null.
    - **Camera Overlay & Upload**: Camera button on avatar launches camera/gallery sheet, compresses, uploads via `POST /upload` multipart form, updates via `PATCH /delivery-partners/me/profile`, and calls `checkAuth()` for state sync.
- **Admin Tracking Panel UI & Sub-Navigation** (`client-admin/src/app/(admin)/tracking/`):
  - `layout.tsx` — Persistent sidebar navigation containing a dynamic right-side fixed-positioned flyout popover for the **Live** and **Replay** sub-modules, styled with the project's clean light theme. Click events on the parent menu item are intercepted (`e.preventDefault()`) to prevent accidental page resets, and the parent item retains its hover highlight state (`isFlyoutOpen`) while the flyout menu is active.
  - `/tracking/page.tsx` (Live sub-module) — Cleaned live fleet monitoring dashboard, with page-level tabs and conditional submodule rendering blocks removed.
  - `/tracking/replay/page.tsx` (Replay sub-module) — Separate sub-module page serving as a styled placeholder card for the historical route replay feature.
  - `TrackingMap.tsx` — Interactive OpenStreetMap canvas utilizing Leaflet to display driver pins, pan/zoom to selected drivers, and trigger popup details on click.
